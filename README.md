# User-Registry

This project is essentially a digital "ID Office" where users can sign up and get a secure account. It's a foundational web application built with React for the snappy frontend, SpringBoot handling the heavy lifting and security on the backend, and MySQL acting as the meticulous record keeper—allowing authorized users to not only view all the accounts but also modify or completely erase their own digital footprint, making it a great exploration of the full MERN/Spring stack.
